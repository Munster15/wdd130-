        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        [My site will consist of three pages that all sell my skills to people looking to hire someone with my skill set. 
          Basically, recruiters, patrons, and clients will come to my site to find someone to hire. 
          I will have an opening page with the basic data required for a performing artistâ€™s portfolio such as height, weight, and age, 
          alongside headshots like the ones a casting company usually requires. 
          Below that will be a short statement about myself, who I am, my background in each area, and what I plan on doing in the performing art world. 
          The main page will also include brief blurbs about what the next two pages contain, alongside pictures so that my talents are emphasized. 
          One page will be my performing arts, and will have my dance styles, musical instruments, acting pieces, 
          and other minor assorted talents that could be useful in performing displayed on it. 
          The other will be my art page and will consist of my photography and a few drawing pieces that I have made. 
          Overall, the first page will be an introduction to me and a quick overview of all of the skills that they could hire me for, 
          while the child pages will go into more detail. ]

      </ul>
      <h3>[Performing Art]</h3>
      <p>
        [On the first subpage the people looking at my page will look for a polished portfolio with a variety of skills and abilities. 
          They will want to know what I can do in the fields of dance, music, acting, and assorted skills that come in handy. 
          The styles of dance that I have been trained in, the instruments that I play, and how long I have been doing everything will be important, 
          crucial information on this page. The content on this page will mainly be video and audio files, images, text files, 
          choreography sheets, sheet music, and descriptions of each of the pieces I am performing so that everything is understandable. 
          I will organize the page into the categories I have already laid out: dance (ballet, ballroom, modern, jazz, and contemporary), 
          music (voice, flute, violin, guitar, and piano), acting (various acting pieces from my library), 
          and other skills I have that they might find make me a better performer 
          (minor gymnastics background, flexibility, knife throwing, gun handling, archery, crocheting, sewing, embroidery, swimming, languages, and more). 
          This page will be for casting directors, or recruiters looking for someone to bring onto their next project. ]

      </ul>
      <h3>[Art]</h3>
      <p>
        [The second subpage will be my be my artist webpage. 
          Here I will build a display of my favorite pieces of photography and art that I have done. 
          This will be for people wishing to hire me for my artist talents, and will have a variety of styles, hopefully. 
          In photography there will be portraits, action shots, landscapes, and more. 
          I love photography, and want to be able to see the world and capture beautiful shots, 
          which starts with getting the right people interested in your work, which is what this page will do. 
          Then, the artwork. Mostly, it will be cartoon-like sketches, as that is currently what I am best at, but it will evolve to include painting, 
          more realistic sketches, and other styles of artwork as I go. I also plan on eventually having wood artwork, 
          like burned wood on here, as well as sculpting, as clay is one of my favorite mediums to work with. 
          All in all, this will be a place for people to look for an artisan, and perhaps I will put my jewelry, sewing, crocheting, and embroidery on here,
          as some people definitely consider that art. This page will require a lot of laying out of images, as that will be the main medium for it. ]
