                My name is Malie Smith, and I don't really have a nickname. 
            Currently I am working on a dance major, but I am still trying to decide and am putting some thought into other majors, such as programming.
            I enjoy doing a lot things, so I have a lot of hobbies, such as; dance, playing instruments, singing, reading, jewelry making, rock climbing, swimming, soccer, origami, and art.
            As of now I am still a single pringle, and am not planning on changing that for a while!
            I am applying for a job right now still, but luckily I have two applications in the approval part of the process.
            I feel that there are a lot of advantages in web design, solely because it is such a rapidly growing industry. I am taking the course to see if I enjoy it, and I hope to get an idea of if a career in this field is a good idea for me out of it.

            My parents were sealed in the temple, so I have been a member since I was baptized at eight, but I do know a lot of nonmembers because of where I live. 
            I think my favorite quote is from Elder Uchtdorf's 'Forget Me Not' talk when the flower cries out, "Forget me not, O Lord!" because I feel that many feel that way at times, including myself. 
            My favorite scripture is John 14:27; Peace I leave with you, my peace give I unto you; not as the world givethe, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
